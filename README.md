## Edge Computing and Distributed Database Systems
**Course:** Advanced Database Systems

**Abstract** 

With the increasing demand for faster computations and seamless communication between operational systems, traditional technologies such as cloud computing are proving insufficient for modern applications like autonomous vehicles and smart cities. Edge computing emerges as a promising solution to address these challenges, enabling real-time processing and efficient resource utilization. This paper examines edge computing to explore its functionality and evaluate its potential in meeting the demands of contemporary technologies. This report was prepared using a comprehensive review of scientific papers, in order to make sure the information presented is reliable and accurate.  The analysis helped us understand the core concept of Edge Computing and Distributed Database Systems, and revealed the importance of them in various applications, such as Industrial IoT and Autonomous Vehicles. Design strategies, such as Data Partitioning and Replication Strategies, for Edge Databases were addressed as well, along with security challenges that need to be overcome, and some practices that are implemented to encounter these challenges. What is more, we examine how future advancements in technologies, like 5G Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, can affect the potential of the Edge Databases.
